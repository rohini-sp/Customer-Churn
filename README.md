# Customer-Churn
Problem statement for Churn Prediction:
Understanding the problem statement is the first step of model building.
Here we are given a dataset of bank customers, and we want to build a churn prediction model that can classify customers into two classes: potential churners and non-churners. 
This classification problem is solved via a supervised learning approach, meaning we will have labelled Input and Output data samples. 
This model should be precise as it might affect the future investments of the bank.
